🏫 PRIA School Showcase Website
📖 About the Project

Ye project maine apne school ke liye banaya hai (PRIA School).
Jab maine dekha ki school ki purani website Site123 se bani thi jisme limited features the —
na admission form tha, na fee payment option, aur design bhi basic tha —
tab maine socha ki ek custom, responsive aur modern website banaun jo students aur parents ke liye easy ho.
